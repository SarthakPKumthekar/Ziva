# How This Has Been Tested #
This PR adds new automated tests check that the vorpal sword can slide through paper,
in addition to the existing tests on jabberwocky tissue.
I also swung the new and old swords around for a bit to get a feel for the difference. It's barely noticeable.

# Secondary Impacts #
What other things have changes? Performance, usability, robustness, tech-debt, new/lost capabilities?

This change sharpens the stability of the vorpal sword, but makes it a little heavier.
The new mass is noted in the user-facing specifications document.
